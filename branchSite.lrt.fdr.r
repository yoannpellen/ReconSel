# Written for the analysis of multiple testing of many branches of a tree (or set of trees) using the branch-site model
# Based on the practice in the SELECTOME pipeline (group of Marc Robinson-Rechavi)
# Uses the qvalue algorithm: Storey and Tibshirani PNAS 2003 "Statistical significance for genome-wide experiments"
# implemented in the qvalue package: http://genomics.princeton.edu/storeylab/qvalue/

# Input: csv file with the following fields: lnull,lalt  (could have additional fields such as ID, which will be ignored but printed to output)
# lnull is the lnL under the null model and lalt is the likelihood under the alternative model
# FDR correction set at 0.05
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))

# The install is only needed if the package wasn't already installed, it's better to mask it after as it can cause troubles if there's a new version
